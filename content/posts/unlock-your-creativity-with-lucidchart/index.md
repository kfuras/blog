![Shape Libraries and Templates][image-37]

Lucidchart’s comprehensive shape libraries can help you embrace your creative flair when constructing various diagrams. It allows for customizing the shapes to fit any specific diagram needs, like flowcharts, UML diagrams, or BPMN diagrams.

By using its pre-built templates it is easy to save time and jumpstart the process of creating a diagram, so instead of starting from scratch, all essential elements are already available allowing you to focus on fine-tuning them according to your requirements.

Lucidchart makes sure that no detail goes overlooked in terms of both customization and efficiency!

### Customizable Shape Libraries

Shape libraries can be customized to fit your diagramming needs. You can create a library of custom shapes, customize them with the flex polygon shape, group various shapes together, or upload new ones from outside sources. To personalize even more. You may add any desired shape by right-clicking on it and choosing ‘Add to Custom Shape Library’, or simply drag and drop it into the left panel in Lucidchart’s library.

### Time-Saving Templates

Lucidchart offers templates that are ready to use, which makes it effortless and convenient for creating diagrams. You can tailor the pre-made template in any way you want so there is no need to draw from scratch. The Lucidchart editor allows teams to make adjustments as per their requirement with ease. Diagrams such as UML sequence diagrams, data flow charts, or even normal workflow charting could be quickly generated using these templated layouts.

## Collaborate in Real-Time with Lucidchart

Lucidchart enables teams to collaborate more effectively with features such as in-editor chat, real-time co-authoring, shape-specific comments, and collaborative cursors. These functionalities permit teams to edit a document simultaneously while staying connected via the built-in chat feature for smoother communication between collaborators.

Craft dynamic organization charts and entity relationship diagrams by using smart containers to layer data on top of the diagrams. Smart boxes enable teams to visually keep track of activities, statuses, services, and candidates as they progress through process flows. You can also customize them so that your exact needs are met.

Create visual depictions that reference live spreadsheet data like CSV files or Google Sheets with Excel – make these compositions driven solely by information from those sources.

### Conditional Formatting

Conditional formatting in Lucidchart allows you to set rules that modify the properties of certain elements depending on given conditions, thereby emphasizing key data and simplifying complex information for different audiences. By using conditional formatting, it is possible to present insights quickly and effectively as well as make sure important aspects are not overlooked or forgotten by visualizing all your diagrams’ data.
